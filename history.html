      <h2>History of Studio Ghibli</h2>
      <p>
        Hayao Miyazaki, Isao Takahata, and Toshio Suzuki created Studio Ghibli
        in 1985, but Miyazaki and Takahata's friendship goes back much further.
        A collaborative partnership that would last throughout their lives began
        when the two first worked together in 1964. Before 1984, when Hayao
        Miyazaki's first original feature film Nausicaä of the Valley of the
        Wind became a commercial and critical success, they had both contributed
        to a number of Japanese motion pictures and television programs.
        <br /><br />
        Despite not being a true Studio Ghibli production, Nausicaä is
        distinctly Miyazaki and exhibits some of the characteristics that help
        to define his style. It contains a strong pro-environmental theme and a
        heroine at the core of the narrative, both of which recur in his
        subsequent films. <br /><br />

        On Nausicaä, Toshio Suzuki worked on the production crew. Encouraged by
        how well the movie did, Miyazaki and Suzuki made the decision to start
        their own studio and asked Takahata to join them. The Tokyo-based
        publishing house Tokuma-Shoten provided the capital required to launch
        Studio Ghibli, beginning a journey that would yield 21 feature films and
        earn the company a reputation as one of the top animation companies in
        the world. The way I've put it here makes it sound like it was a
        straight line to success, but it wasn’t quite that straightforward.
