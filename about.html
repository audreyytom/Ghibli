      <h2>About Studio Ghibli</h2>
      <p>
        Animators and directors Miyazaki Hayao and Takahata Isao, along with
        producer Suzuki Toshio, established the renowned Japanese animation film
        studio Studio Ghibli in 1985. Studio Ghibli is renowned for its artistic
        talent and for the excellent caliber of its films. Its feature films
        received appreciation from critics and the general public and had an
        impact on other animation studios. Headquarters are located in Tokyo.
        <br /><br />
        Japanese animation director Miyazaki Hayao (born January 5, 1941 in
        Tokyo, Japan) is renowned for his lyrical and allusive creations.
        <br /><br />

        The director of Miyazaki Airplane, a company that produced components
        for Zero fighter planes, was Miyazaki's father. The family company gave
        Miyazaki a passion for flying, which was evident in almost all of his
        works. He began working as an entry-level animator at Tei Animation, a
        part of the Tei studio and Asia's largest producer of animation, in 1963
        after completing his studies in economics at Gakushin University in
        Tokyo. He made friends with Takahata Isao and Ta Akemi while he was a
        student at T'ei. The first became a long-term friend, business
        colleague, and collaborator, while the second, after a year of romance,
        became his wife. <br /><br />
        As he rose through the ranks at Tei, Miyazaki worked on a variety of
        projects, including the television series "Wolf Boy Ken" and Takahata's
        first feature-length directorial effort, Taiyo no ji: Horusu no daibken
        (1968; Little Norse Prince). Miyazaki and Takahata continued to work for
        other studios throughout the 1970s after leaving Tei in 1971.
